# A SIMPLE BLOG

This is my first project using NodeJs. The blog supports three basic CRUD operations: insert, delete and fetch. It uses NodeJs for the backend and MongoDb as the database. I have built this site following a tutorial in a channel called Net Ninja on YouTube. The backend is hosted at https://blog-first123.herokuapp.com/
